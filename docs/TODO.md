# TODO NOW LIST:
[ ]

# TODO NEXT LIST: (don't do now. could have semi finished job tasks)
[ ]

----

## NOTES TO REMEMBER:
- Read `docs/_AGENTS_START_HERE-GUIDE.md` thoroughly (mainly AGENTS.md and RULES.md; memorize them, as they are the two most important files for Agents).
- Make suggestions to me before implementing anything.
- Ignore the TODOs embedded in the code!
- Review and modify only /src, mainly src/organicText.h/cpp, and if necessary, ofApp.h/.cpp.
- Do not touch main.cpp.
- If you need to (and I authorize you to) run the app, use Debug since Release is not configured properly. But I'll take care of compiling and running it.
- Don't do git commits, just ask me to do it when there are major changes or new features working.
